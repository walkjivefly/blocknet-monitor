## Installation

1. Download Blocknet Platorm Monitor either from [here](https://github.com/walkjivefly/blocknet-monitor/releases) or by cloning this  repository.
2. Edit `src/Config.php` to enter your blocknetd RPC credentials, set a password and change other settings.
3. Upload the folder to the public directory of your web server. If the folder is accesible via the internet, I recommend renaming the folder to something unique. Although Blocknet Monitor is password protected and access can be limited to a specific IP, there can be security flaws and bugs.
4. Open the URL to the folder in your browser and login with the password choosen in `src/Config.php`.
5. Optional: Run `chmod -R 770 /path-to-folder/{data, src, views}`. Only necessary for non Apache (`AllowOverride All` necessary) and publicly accessible web server. For more information, read the next section.


## Security
 
* Access to Blocknet Monitor is by default limited to localhost. This can be expanded to a specific IP or disabled. If disabled, make sure to protect the Blocknet Monitor folder (.htaccess, rename it to something unique 
that an attacker will not guess). An attacker could "guess" your password, since there is no build-in brute force protection (if IP protection is disabled).
* The `data` folder contains your rules, logs and geo information about your peers. Make sure to protect (e.g. `chmod -R 770 data`) this sensitive information if your web server is publicly accessible. The previously mentioned
IP protection doesn't work here. If you use `Apache` you are fine, since the folder is protected with `.htaccess` (make sure `AllowOverride All` is set in your `apache2.conf` file).
